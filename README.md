This repository contains the first lab exercise for the Earth System Modelling (ESM) course. The goal of this notebook is to read, analyze, and visualize climate data stored in NetCDF files.

The notebook provides a basic introduction to working with NetCDF data using xarray, matplotlib, and cartopy, along with examples of spatial and temporal data visualization.
The LAB_ESM.ipynb notebook covers the following topics:

    📦 Reading NetCDF files with xarray

    📊 Basic statistical analysis of climate variables (maximum, minimum, mean)

    🌍 Spatial data visualization using Cartopy

    📈 Time series plotting with Matplotlib

    🗺️ Global mean surface temperature maps
